## What we are working on:

- Start recognizing urls in /add/.

- Create a crypto hash for every url.

- Work on the db and the connection.

## Functions that can already be used

Nothing can be used right now, the tool is under development. So, until we don't get rid of the ALPHA version, we are going to be testing everything and than we will release the software with the necessary documentation.

## Available in future

url.com/add/Your-Link-Here - This function will allow you to put your link by hand in the system.

url.com/u/CodeHere - This function will allow you to enter your shortened url.

url.com/login/ - This page will allow you to login and see your shortened urls.
